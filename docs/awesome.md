This is particularly important for users who rely on AI platforms with usage restrictions or for those working with resource-intensive tasks, such as large

## Types of Prompts

There are several types of prompts that can be used to elicit different types of responses from AI language models. They can be broadly categorized into three types: open-ended prompts, closed-end prompts, and guided prompts. 

### Open-ended Prompts

Open-ended prompts are designed to encourage AI language models to generate diverse and creative responses. They provide the model with the freedom to explore various ideas, perspectives, and solutions without imposing strict limitations on the output. Open-ended prompts are particularly useful when seeking innovative ideas, brainstorming, or addressing complex problems that require a broader range of perspectives.

#### Real-World Examples of Open-Ended Prompts
