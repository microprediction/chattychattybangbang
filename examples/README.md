Results are highly stochastic. Just having fun here. For this you can do the following: 

    from chattychattybangbang.castigateuntilvalid import castigate_until_numeric_dict
    from pprint import pprint

    d_all = dict()
    for _ in range(5):
        pomposity_question = """ I would like you to produce a list of ten famous intellectuals of the twentieth century and
                       assign a pomposity score to them between 1 (not pompous) to 10 (extremely pompous). 
                       Please return this as a dictionary keyed by the person's name in lowercase where the 
                       value should be an integer. Only return a dictionary, sorted from most pompous down.

        castigator = lambda question_response: pomposity_question + " Make sure you return only a dict, and the complete dict. Do not finish printing"
        d = castigate_until_numeric_dict(question=pomposity_question, castigator=castigator, max_retries=10)
        if d is not None:
